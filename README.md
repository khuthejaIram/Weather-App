The Weather App project is a web application that leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch weather data from a weather API and display current weather conditions and forecasts for a specific location. It provides users with real-time weather information, allowing them to stay informed about the weather conditions in their desired location.

The Weather App utilizes an API (in this example, the WeatherAPI) to retrieve weather data based on the userâ€™s input location. The application dynamically fetches the current weather information. It then presents this data in a user-friendly format, making it easy for users to understand and interpret.
